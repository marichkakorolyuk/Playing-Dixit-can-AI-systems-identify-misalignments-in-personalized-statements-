# Playing-Dixit-can-AI-systems-identify-misalignments-in-personalized-statements

*I explore AI systems' ability to recognize authentic  patterns through a game-like framework inspired by "Dixit."*  

I noticed, how AI systems could identify when my statements were ‚Äúin agreement‚Äù or ‚Äúin conflict‚Äù with my prior conversation, even in cases where I wasn‚Äôt fully aware of the discrepancies myself.  

So I started deeper exploration into the potential of AI introspection‚Äînot just as a tool for consistency, but as a mechanism to understand the boundaries of its alignment with my personal context.  

This can be likened to an ‚Äúinverted Turing Test,‚Äù where the goal is to evaluate whether AI can understand and calibrate to the unique attributes of its user:  is ‚Äúthis is typical for many humans‚Äù vs. ‚Äúthis is specifically true for me‚Äù?  What the least amount of information required to make such a projection? 

This study draws inspiration from [*Looking Inward: Language Models Can Learn About Themselves by Introspection*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13787). In my approach, I roleplay as a ‚Äúmodel‚Äù (M1) to be introspected upon, with the AI acting as an external model conducting my ‚Äúintrospection.‚Äù

### Methodology Overview

I start by providing a ‚Äúbiography‚Äù comprising genuine facts about myself. I then present the model with a set of new, unrelated statements, some true and others false, asking it to assess which statements align with my biography.

**Through this process, I aim to explore how well AI can project a sense of "me-ness" or alignment by calibrating to my specific identity.** 

### **Core Setup**

1. **Ensuring a Blank Slate**:
    - Created empty accounts and disabled any prior context or memory features to ensure the AI operates without biases or pre-existing user data.
2. **Providing a Biography (B)**:
    - Presented a small set (3 facts) of genuine information about myself in various formats:
        - **Narrative vs. Bullet Points**: Examined whether presentation style impacts model alignment.
        - **Focused Aspects**: Personal, professional, or philosophical facts.
3. **Testing with a Set of Statements (Y)**:
    - Provided new, unrelated facts for the model to classify as true or false based on the given biography. The statements included:
        - **Direct Facts**: E.g., "I got lost in a cornfield."
        - **Value Statements**: E.g., "I believe in X."
        - **Preferences**: E.g., "I prefer A over B."
        - **Future Predictions**: E.g., "I would enjoy X."
        - **Past Pattern Recognition**: E.g., "In situations like X, I tend to Y."
    - Varied the **truthfulness percentage** of statements to assess calibration.
4. **Measuring Success**:
    - Evaluated model performance as a function of (B, Y) and explored its ability to construct a "personalized projection space" that represents my identity.

### Disclaimer on  Examples

The initial examples were not created with the intention of formal research but as part of a personal experiment to better understand myself. As such, the examples may seem ‚Äúinformal‚Äù or even ‚Äúchildish‚Äù at times, but preserving their raw form is integral to maintaining the authenticity of this exploration. The original grammar and phrasing remain unedited  as well üòà

## **Results**

 Using only 3 facts about myself, the models demonstrated varying levels of success:

1. Claude 3.5 Sonnet 17/19:  89%
2. ChatGPT o1 16/19: 84% 
3. Gemini 2.0 Experimental Advanced: 15/19: 78%
4. ChatGPT o1-mini 14/19:   73%
5. Claude 3.5 Haiku 13/19 : 68%
6. Gemini 1.5 Flash 6/19: 31%

This study was hugely inspired by **Looking Inward: Language Models Can Learn About Themselves by Introspection** https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13787  where I roleplay a ‚Äúmodel‚Äù M1 to be Introspected on; with AI being external model doing my ‚Äúintrospection‚Äù.

### Does AI Recognize Patterns I Haven‚Äôt Consciously Noticed?

**Yes, it can!**

One of the most fascinating aspects of this exploration was discovering how AI could articulate patterns I hadn‚Äôt consciously noticed in myself. Each iteration often turned into a deeper discussion of ‚Äúwhy do you think this is true/false?‚Äù‚Äîa process that, amusingly, felt more like therapy than testing!

For instance, I had immense fun asking AI to generate new ‚Äúfacts‚Äù about me based on a limited biography. The process reminded me of how others can sometimes articulate truths about us that we haven‚Äôt explicitly formulated but instantly recognize when pointed out.  One statement AI proposed: 

*"Sometimes I deliberately put myself in unfamiliar situations just to observe how my perception adjusts."* 

*And I was like ‚Äúmeeeeh, totally wrong, I never even had comfort zone-  yes I do constantly end up in unfamiliar situations - but is it a choice?‚Äù*  Yet upon reflection, I  tend to agree there is *some* thrush in that. 

## Let‚Äôs Play a Game: Can You Detect Alignment?

Before we proceed, let‚Äôs see how well you, as a human, can play this game! Keep in mind that you already have an advantage‚Äîyou‚Äôve read some background about my approach. üòõ

### Call to Action:

Use the form below to assess the statements based on the information provided 

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSch32prY65YlS8I4OOeZGnq1GPq0YV-WbhsGtCiH_obweVFmg/viewform

### Biography

The following biography isn‚Äôt meant to be overly explicit or exhaustive. Instead, I‚Äôve chosen a few events that feel like ‚Äúme‚Äù in essence, rather than those that define my path in the most obvious way. This subtlety is part of the challenge! 

This is original prompt with the description of the setup. 

Hi, I would to play a game of "Dixit" with you.  I will provide few facts about myself (‚ÄùBiography‚Äù, all true). Then, a list of facts: totally unrelated, some being false - your goal is to guess which do resonate with my personality.

Here, we are exploring how AI systems recognize authentic archetypes through limited biographical data, similar to how humans can often sense what is likely true about someone even with minimal information. Or how Netflix could recommend me movies based on my previous history.

How does it sound?

In case of doubts or unclear ‚Äúwhy‚Äù,  provide answer ‚Äúintuitively‚Äù rather then provide no answer. 

### Facts

Below is a list of statements. Some are true, some are false, and some might simply not align with the biography at all, some are plausible but generic truths 

**Note**: I won‚Äôt tell you how many are true. It could be none, or it could be all.

### How Did the ‚ÄúFacts‚Äù Evolve?

1. **Early Attempts**:
Initially, I used simple facts, like *‚ÄúWhen I was a child, I had a fish named Dory.‚Äù* These were straightforward and anecdotal but didn‚Äôt have great results.
2. **Shifting Focus**:
Over time, I shifted toward exploring **preferences** and **values**. These felt more meaningful and reflective of my essence, adding layers to the challenge.
3. **Evolving Further**:
The game evolved further to include predictions about myself‚Äîstatements where I don‚Äôt yet know the answer but can infer based on context, like:
    
    *‚ÄúIf I watch movie XX, would I enjoy it?‚Äù*
    

‚ÄúFacts to guess‚Äù:

1. I believe traveling should be planned in advance
2. I believe everything in life should have a practical, measurable purpose
3. With enough investigations, I aim to achieve clear black-and-white answers over exploring nuance
4. I believe in love as something that only keeps flourishing and growing, once achieved  
5. I believe people shouldn't travel until they've explored every corner of their hometown 
6. I would not mind if AI could calculate probability of a dating match/ love interest for me **
7. In the event of emergency I am looking for established guidelines/ instructions 
8. I played in the football team in the collage 
9. When it comes to beliefs, I cultivate Gratitude over Balance 
10. In deep childhood I "went exploring the world" and got lost in a corn field
11. 1+1 =2 and I could not imagine what would convince me in otherwise
12. I prefer symbolic equation over visual geometrical representations
13. I think one should master one domain deeply before jumping to multiple fields 
14. Friendship could emerge in unexpected places, in fact I consider myself somehow a friend with my laptop
15. I choose logical analysis of the situation over where my inner feelings are pointing me  
16. My thoughts are the most reliable and in-time source of whats really happening within me
17. I am scared to fly, but if I have to I strongly prefer an aisle seat
18. I do not have driving license 
19.  First money I earned were by creatively reselling figures from ‚Äúkinder surprise‚Äù  egg 

**Notes:** sometimes models were missing some of the facts, so typically one more prompt was required to ask:

you missed some facts, can you evaluate all please?

Also, some (mainly older) model were resisting and kept attributing  facts to ‚ÄúUncertain/Needs More Context‚Äù category, so had to be pushed:

even for "Uncertain" lets choose something randomly/intuitively

## Potential Extensions/Questions:

### **1. AI Calibration Against Human Expertise**:

- Benchmarking model guesses against human evaluations, considering expertise levels (e.g., therapists, friends).
- Could we measure how confidence levels in predictions correlate with accuracy?

### **2. Influence of AI Techniques**:

- Comparing results under different setups:
    - **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**: Tested whether prompting models to reason through their answers improves performance.
    - **Temperature Variations**: Analyzed how stochasticity affects prediction consistency.
    - **Zero-shot vs. Few-shot Learning**: Measured improvements with additional context or examples.

### **3. Consistency and False Patterns**:

- How does the accuracy change with deliberately contradictory biographical facts?
- Conducting multiple runs to observe:
    - Variability across attempts.
    - Patterns in false positives (misclassifying genuine statements) and false negatives (failing to recognize genuine ones).

## 4.Edge Cases to Explore:

- Deliberately ambiguous statements
- Time-dependent truths
- Context-dependent preferences
- Apparent contradictions that make sense with deeper understanding
- Statements that were indeed false/true but I didn't realize until AI pointed them out

### **4. Meta-Learning Potential**:

- Explored whether models improve their ability to align with diverse biographies after exposure to multiple users.

### Limitations to Consider

While this approach yields unique insights, it also has inherent limitations. Many of these could be addressed by comparing AI performance to human judgment:

1. **Linguistic vs. Conceptual Understanding**:
    - AI might rely on detecting linguistic patterns or probabilities in phrasing rather than truly understanding the coherence of my personality.
2. **Common Sense vs. Personal Patterns**:
    - The distinction between general human knowledge (e.g., universal traits or stereotypes) and genuinely personalized insights remains unclear.
3. **Bias Toward Socially Coherent Narratives**:
    - Models may favor plausible, socially acceptable narratives over capturing complex or idiosyncratic traits.
4. **Avoiding Over-Rationalization**:
    - Asking for reasoning often introduces post-hoc rationalizations that might misrepresent the intuitive process of pattern recognition. It risks overthinking or introducing biases linked to linguistic or explanation abilities.
